# Installing The Project 

**1:** Once code is downloaded from the zip folder, create a folder named "react" inside laragon root folder.

**2:** Place team folder within react folder that you just created in laragon root folder.

**3:** Then in Laragon you have to add a datebase. Go to Menu in Laragon, then MySQL, then create datatbase.

**4:** Now if you know your root password go to the backend folder in the project and go to the config.php and change the password to your password in the PDO.
If you do not have the password. You have to change your password to what is inside the config.php in the backend folder **"Pa11word"**. To do that you have to go to Laragon > Menu > MySQL > change root password

This allows the config.php file to run.

**5:** Click database on laragon then initialize database connection. Once you have done that you have to select the database. When you are in you have to go to query and add the following:

>**CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS recipe_tbl( recipe_id INT(6) AUTO_INCREMENT NOT NULL
                                                        ,recipe_name VARCHAR (60),
                                                        recipe_cooktime VARCHAR (60),
                                                        recipe_ingredients VARCHAR (100),
                                                        PRIMARY KEY (recipe_id)
                                                        )**
   
**6:** Then you have to click the blue triangle to run the query to add the table.

**7:** In laragon terminal, change directory to **"react/team-folder-name"** . Then run **"npm start"** 

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
